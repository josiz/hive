# First we need to add the line "net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1" to /etc/sysctl.conf
#
#
# Because login.42.fr has three different IP:s, we need to redirect all three of them.
# Redirecting all three IP:s requires three lines as so:
#
# "iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d [ipaddress1] -j DNAT --to-destination [ipaddress2]"
#
# ipaddress1 is redirected to ipaddress2
